# Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my Python Learning repo. This is a personal journey to learn Python from the ground up â€” from basic syntax to advanced topics like object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and more.

## Why This Repo

This repo is designed to:
- Track my Python learning progress
- Practice core programming concepts
- Organize code and notes by topic
- Encourage feedback and improvement

## Structure

The repo is organized by topics and increasing complexity:

### 01_basics/
This folder contains files introducing basic Python concepts.

- **variables.py**: Introduction to variables and how to assign them in Python.
- **data_types.py**: An explanation of different data types in Python (e.g., integers, strings, lists, etc.).

### 02_control_flow/
Here you'll find examples of control flow in Python.

- **if_statements.py**: How to use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
- **loops.py**: Demonstrates looping mechanisms (`for` and `while` loops).

### 03_functions/
This folder focuses on functions, how to define and use them in Python.

### 04_oop/
A deep dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, and more.

### 05_modules/
In this section, you will learn about Python modules and how to import and use them.

### projects/
This folder contains small projects that utilize the concepts learned in the tutorials.

- **mini_calculator.py**: A simple Python project that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations.

## Topics Covered

- Python syntax and indentation
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (if, else, elif)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling
- Modules, error handling, and more



Each folder contains focused examples and exercises to practice and reinforce each topic.

## Goals

- Learn and understand the core syntax and features of Python
- Write clean, modular, and reusable code
- Apply programming concepts through small, hands-on projects
- Build confidence to take on real-world Python development
- Maintain consistent coding practice and documentation habits

## Tools Used

- **Visual Studio Code** for writing and running code
- **GitHub** for version control, backup, and tracking learning progress

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and navigate to the different folders to explore the examples and projects. You can run the Python scripts directly in your terminal or an IDE.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chenzie2/python-learning.git
cd python-learning
```

## Notes

This repository is strictly for learning purposes. All code is written manually and incrementally, with the intent to experiment, make mistakes, and improve. Contributions, feedback, and pull requests are encouraged to improve the code quality and learning effectiveness. Please feel free to share any tips or resources to help improve this repository.
